Processing:
To run the processing code please go to the processing_code folder. This code cleans and wrangles the data. Run this code by selecting "run all". Inside this code there is a breakdown of the reasoning for each cleaning step.

Analysis: 

First run the exploraty analysis code. Exploratory analysis code is saved under "10-31-19 exploratory analysis" as both an rmd and word document for viewing. This script focuses on looking at relationships between our pathogen of interest, Arcobacter butzleri and other contaminents or water quality indicators. These are not final figures, but rather an exploration of the data. 

Second, run the "11-7-19 univariate analysis code". This code will save all univariate figures in the results folder. This includes final figures and tables for the maniscript.

Thrid, run the "11-7-19 bivariate code". This code will save all univariate figures in the results folder. This includes final figures and tables for the maniscript.

Fourth, run the "11-7-19 tree". This code will produce a random forest tree. It may take 5-15 minutes to run depending on your computer. This code includes a final random forest tree for the manuscript.
