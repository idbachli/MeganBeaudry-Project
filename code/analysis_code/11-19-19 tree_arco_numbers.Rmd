This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

MOVE
Move the outcome variable to the first row
```{r reorder}

SPLIT data
```{r split data}

#uncomment to run
