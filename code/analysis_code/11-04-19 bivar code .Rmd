## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r library}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(ggthemes)
library(plotly)
library(knitr)
library(naniar)
library(broom)
library(gridExtra)
library(zoo)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load data}
clean_water_quality_data <- readRDS("../../data/processed_data/clean_water_quality_data.rds")
#if this happens you need to save the file first cause it do
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
