## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
clean_water_quality_data <- readRDS("../../data/processed_data/clean_water_quality_data.rds")
#if you get an error - this happens because you need to save the file first cause it refers to a relative path 
clean_data <- clean_water_quality_data
```

MOVE
Move the outcome variable to the first row
```{r reorder}
clean_data_2 <- clean_data[, c(15,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,18, 19)]
```


SPLIT data
```{r split data}

library(caret)
#this code does the data splitting. I still assume that your data is stored in the `d` object.
#uncomment to run
set.seed(123)
#extract observations/rows for training, assign to new variable. 
#Extracts 70% of the data into the trainset
trainset <- caret::createDataPartition(y = clean_data_2$A_butzleri_HSP60, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
#subsets out the dataset
data_train = clean_data_2[trainset,] 
#do the same for the test set
data_test = clean_data_2[-trainset,] 
```


Single Predictor
```{r}
#code below provided by Dr. H
#There is probably a nicer tidyverse way of doing this. I just couldn't think of it, so did it this way.
set.seed(1111) #makes each code block reproducible
outcomename= "A_butzleri_HSP60"
fitControl <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv",number=5,repeats=5) #setting CV method for caret
Npred <- ncol(data_train)-1 # number of predictors
resultmat <- data.frame(Variable = names(data_train)[-1], RMSE = rep(0,Npred)) #store values for RMSE for each variable
for (n in 2:ncol(data_train)) #loop over each predictor. For this to work, outcome must be in 1st column
{
  fit0 <- train( as.formula(paste(outcomename, "~", names(data_train)[n])) , data = data_train, method = "lm", trControl = fitControl) 
  resultmat[n-1,2]= fit0$results$RMSE  
}
print(resultmat)
```
